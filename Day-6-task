Intro and What is Numpy
-Numpy stands for Numerical Python. It is a python library used for working with arrays.It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra,
 fourier transform, and matrices.
-In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster
 than traditional Python lists.The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
-As in python the concept of pointers is missing so we can say that numpy serves this functionality in python and help us to manage the memory efficiently.

Why numpy arrays
-NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
 This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists
 
Limitations of numpy
-Using “nan” in Numpy: “Nan” stands for “not a number”. ...
-Require a contiguous allocation of memory: Insertion and deletion operations become costly as data is stored in contiguous memory locations as shifting it requires shifting.

Installation Req
-Python 3
-pip install numpy
-pip install jupyter

Numpy ndarray objects
-The most important object defined in NumPy is an N-dimensional array type called ndarray. It describes the collection of items of the same type.
-Every item in an ndarray takes the same size of block in the memory. Each element in ndarray is an object of data-type object (called dtype).
